<h2 id="_event_streams"><a class="anchor" href="#_event_streams"></a>Event streams</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event streams are very popular to represent changes to data. They allow individual
modifications to be represented as atomic operations that are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>associated with timestamp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uniquely identifiable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carry all relevant information to the objects they reference</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Workflows are perfect fit into processing event streams as they can provide
additional view of the domain changes equipped with business logic to allow
description why and how the data has changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-events.png" alt="use case events">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above diagram illustrates simple order processing use case that is backed
by event stream. In this particular example Apache Kafka is used as event log
broker but any other solution could replace it. Automatiko seamlessly integrates
with Apache Kafka and thus it is used in the examples that cover supported use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Events in this use case are represented as Key-Value Records. Where key is
the unique identifier e.g. order number and values are appended for each
change to particular order.
From workflow point of view, new instance of the workflow is started as soon
as first event is published with given order number. The order number is
considered as business key - an unique identifier of the workflow instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Automatiko allows to use business key as alternative id of the workflow
instance and by that can be used to reference given instance via API.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the instance is started, every other event published to the event stream
with the same key will correlate to already active instance and push event data
to be able to progress according to business logic defined for given event.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is also important is that business key is not the only correlation that
Automatiko supports. Workflow tags are also used as correlation. This can enable
additional features such as receiving events that are associated with customer
who placed the order, e.g. when customer has updated he shipping address all
ongoing orders should be notified about this change to make sure they will be
sent to the correct location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IoT use case is one of the underestimated when it comes to workflows and at the
same time is one of the most natural fit for workflows. Data produced by sensors
do not have too much value on its own. But associated with business logic
that can produce very powerful solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automatiko allows to cover this use case in number of ways</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>minimal - that allows to build automation directly on IoT devices such as
mini computers (Raspberry PI) or IoT gateways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>private network deployments - automation for IoT devices remains in the same
network as the devices and sensors itself for maximum security and cost efficiency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cloud deployments - automation is placed in the cloud that then enables easier
access to it from any place and any device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mixed of all the above</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The backbone for IoT use case with Automatiko is the MQTT broker that acts as
hub that allows different components to exchange information in the most efficient
way.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-iot.png" alt="use case iot">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above diagram presents a simple case for collecting sensor data in kind of home
automation solution. Different types of sensors publish their data into dedicated
MQTT topics</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>home/roomxxx/temperature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>home/roomxxx/humidity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>home/roomxxx/window</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <code>roomxxx</code> is the identifier of a room of the house such as living room,
bedroom, bathroom, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automatiko allows to define a workflow that can collect sensor data and associate
them with the room it was published for. In this case the room identifier becomes
the correlation so each room publishing its data will be kept in single workflow
instance that allows to build logic around data buckets.
In addition to that Automatiko comes with notion of time windows that the data will
be collected for. This essentially means that given workflow instance will be active
no longer than the time window defines. So one could define business logic
to collect sensor data for an hour and after one hour such workflow instance will be
discarded. Subsequent sensor data for the same room will create new workflow
instance and new time window.</p>
</div>

the <a href="examples/leaks.html">Water leaks detection</a> example</p>

<h2 id="_human_centric_workflows"><a class="anchor" href="#_human_centric_workflows"></a>Human centric workflows</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Human centric workflows is one of the most common use cases for workflows. It was
often promoted by traditional Business Process Management (BPM) solutions. And
indeed, it is still a valid use case as in literally every business there is
human interaction of some kind. Vacation approval, loan application, insurance application
are examples of human centric workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It essentially focuses on automation of human required actions. In some cases
it is to make sure the most appropriate individuals are found to perform work
in other it&#8217;s more important that there is a timely response to the assigned
work. All depends on the domain given workflow is put in.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above use case handles support cases - incidents reported by end users. There can
be many channels that such incident can be reported</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>via email</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>via web form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>via phone call</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of how the data is provided the handling of the case will be similar
or even exactly the same. The case needs to investigated, classified, assigned to
support engineer and finally the case needs to be resolved. As in the end this is
the business goal of such workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automatiko provides support for handling all these stages and efficiently manages
user communication such as</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>assignment of users via individual or groups assignments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notification over email or other channels to make sure assigned actors are aware
of awaiting tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to that having clear visibility into current state of cases is critical.
Having option to build dashboards like entries can significantly improve visibility
and awareness for business stakeholders. In the end it is all about improving
how human actors work with their daily routines and automate whatever is possible.</p>

<h2 id="_service_orchestration"><a class="anchor" href="#_service_orchestration"></a>Service orchestration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Service orchestration is another traditional use case coming from SOA
(Service Oriented Architecture) times. Although it&#8217;s somehow dated it is
certainly relevant nowadays too. It might be even more relevant than before
and that is because of the raise of microservices and event driven architectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These architectures put in front the communication between services, despite
what communication protocol is used (REST/HTTP, messaging, other) there is
always a need to coordinate this communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And for exactly that reason workflows come quite handy to be able to define
the interactions between services in declarative way. In addition to that
it comes with built in features to ensure such communication is done easily
and efficiently. To name just few of these features</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>easy integration with various communication protocols</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>REST backed by OpenAPI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>messaging with out of the box support for Kafka, MQTT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrates with various systems via components backed by Apache Camel</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>declarative security</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>error handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>retry for failed invocations</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-services.png" alt="use case services">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above example shows a simple service orchestration aka coordination of services
that build up rescue personnel information service based on weather forecast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It bundles various features of workflows to provide fully featured coordination
between independent services.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>instances of the workflow are automatically created based on time intervals - every hour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>various services are invoked during execution to fetch data (weather service)
or delegate (alert service, information service, notification service)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each and every service can be either not accessible or returns unexpected response
so workflow is equipped with error handling and retry mechanism to improve fault tolerance</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Service orchestration is not just about calling services or consuming/producing
events, it is also about control logic. What to do based on various condition
is one of the most powerful assets o workflows in this use case. One example of
such control logic is how to handle cases that require undoing already performed
operations.
Workflows come with (again) built in feature called compensations. Compensation
allows to define additional logic that should be invoked when decision about compensating
is taken. This is all defined within the workflow model and by that made explicit
to all involved parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h2 id="_data_base_record_processing"><a class="anchor" href="#_data_base_record_processing"></a>Data base record processing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we know most of the data, nowadays systems deal with are stored in data bases.
Regardless of their type, this data is always a subject of modification.
Systems have to create, read, update and delete data stored in database.
In most of the case all this logic is custom but has well defined life cycle.
This life cycle is defined by business context it resides in.  All this is actually
a defined process on how data (and by whom) can be modified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So for that reason, workflows make a good fit for it as well. It is not to replace
custom code but is to enhance or simplify it.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-database.png" alt="use case database">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above example to handle vacation requests submitted by employees illustrates
how data base records can be used from within workflow to manage its lifecycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use case itself is more about how data is being managed from storage point of view
but still being part of workflow. Every type of data (here person record and vacation
request record) is stored securely in database. But most the modifications to it
are controlled by workflow. Here the benefits of workflow like isolation and
security are clearly visible - each instance is responsible for given set of
data base records.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On top of this, data are kept in db as any other records (that are not managed
by workflow) so they are accessible with any other tool available. It can be used
to build reports, dashboards, backups etc.</p>
