<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_event_streams"><a class="anchor" href="#_event_streams"></a>Event streams</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event streams are very popular for representing data changes. They allow individual
modifications to be represented as atomic operations that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>are associated with a timestamp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are uniquely identifiable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carry all relevant information to the objects they reference</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Workflows are a perfect fit for processing event streams as they can
logically express data changes in terms of business logic
specific to the target domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-events.png" alt="Automatiko order processing use case">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above diagram illustrates a simple order processing use case that is backed
by an event stream. In this particular example <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>
is used as the event log broker, however any other solution could replace it.
Automatiko seamlessly integrates
with Apache Kafka among other event streaming platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Events in this use case are represented as key-value records where key is
the unique order identifier (e.g. order number), and its values are appended for each
change of the particular order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the workflow point of view, a new workflow instance is started as soon
as the first event is published with given order number. The order number is
considered as business key - an unique identifier of the workflow instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Automatiko allows to use business key as alternative id of the workflow
instance and by that can be used to reference a given workflow instance via API.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the workflow instance is started, every new event published to the event stream
that has the same key will be correlated to an already active instance. This new
event is used to progress instance execution according to the workflow business
logic and the event data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s mportant to mention that business keys are not the only correlation that
Automatiko supports. Workflow tags can also be used as correlation.
This opens up additional possibilities, such as receiving events associated
by the customer who placed the order. For example, when a customer has updated his/her
shipping address, all outgoing orders the customer made should be notified about this change
to make sure the order is shipped to this updated location.
This particular use case is depicted in the Automatiko <a href="examples.html#_order_management">Order</a> example.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_internet_of_things_iot"><a class="anchor" href="#_internet_of_things_iot"></a>Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Workflows provide a very natural fit to solving problems in the IoT domain.
Workflow business logic can provide significant additional value to data produced by different sensors (data which
might have little value on its own).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automatiko can be used to cover these use cases in a number of ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>minimal - build automation directly onto IoT devices such as
mini computers (Raspberry PI) or IoT gateways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>private network deployments - automation for IoT devices remains in the same
network as the devices and sensors itself for maximum security and cost efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cloud deployments - automation is placed in the cloud, making it easily accessible from any place and any device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a custom mix of all of the above</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The backbone for IoT use case with Automatiko is the <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> broker that acts as
a hub, allowing different components to exchange information in the most efficient
way possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-iot.png" alt="use case iot">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above diagram presents a simple use case for collecting sensor data typically found
in home automation solutions. In this example different types of sensors publish their data into dedicated
MQTT topics, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>home/roomxyz/temperature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>home/roomxyz/humidity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>home/roomxyz/window</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <code>roomxyz</code> is the identifier of a room of the house such as living room,
bedroom, bathroom, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automatiko allows you to define a workflow that can collect sensor data and associate
it with the room it was published for. In this use case the room identifier becomes
the correlation so each room publishing its data will be kept in a single workflow
instance that allows to build logic around data buckets (in this case, rooms).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, Automatiko comes with notion of a time windows during which data will be collected.
Data windows can be used to control the workflow instance live span. For example we can
define business logic for collecting sensor data for exactly one hour, and after
one hour all collected data can be evaluated for that particular time window.
All consequent sensor data for the same room will be collected by a new workflow instance
and a new time window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h2 id="_human_centric_workflows"><a class="anchor" href="#_human_centric_workflows"></a>Human-centric workflows</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Human-centric workflows is one of the most common use cases for workflows. Ability to
involve human interaction during workflow execution was
often promoted by traditional Business Process Management (BPM) solutions and
indeed, it is still a valid use case as human interactions are present/needed in literally every
business solution. Things like vacation approvals, loan and insurance applications are just
few examples of business solutions that need human interactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Human-centric workflows essentially provide the ability to involve humans during their execution.
This includes ability to assign the most appropriate individuals to perform some work, as well
as make sure they finish the assigned work in a timely manner when this is necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-human.png" alt="Human centric workflow dealing with incident reports">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above use case handles support cases, namely incidents reported by end users. There can
be many channels through which incident can be reported:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>via email</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>via a web form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>via a phone call</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>others</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of how the incident data is provided, the handling of the case will be similar
or even exactly the same. The case first needs to investigated, then classified and assigned to
support engineer, and finally be resolved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automatiko provides support for handling all these stages and efficiently manages
user communication such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>assignment of users via individual or groups assignments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notification over email or other channels to make sure assigned actors are aware
of awaiting tasks</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, having clear visibility into the current state of cases is critical.
Having options to build dashboard-like entries can significantly improve visibility
and awareness for business stakeholders. In the end it is all about improving
how human actors work with their daily routines and automate whatever is possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h2 id="_service_orchestration"><a class="anchor" href="#_service_orchestration"></a>Service orchestration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Service orchestration is another traditional use case coming from SOA
(Service Oriented Architecture) times. Although it&#8217;s somewhat dated, it is
certainly still relevant. It might be even more relevant now with
the rise of microservices and event driven architectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These architectures focus on communication between services, despite
what communication protocol is used (REST/HTTP, messaging, other). There is
always a need to coordinate this communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For exactly that reason workflows come quite handy for defining
interactions between services in a declarative way. In addition to that
workflows comes with built in features to ensure such communication is done easily
and efficiently. Some of these features include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>easy integration with various communication protocols</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>REST backed by OpenAPI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>messaging with out of the box support for Kafka, MQTT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integration with various systems via components backed by Apache Camel</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>declarative security</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>error handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>retry for failed invocations</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-services.png" alt="Simple service orchestration example">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above example shows a simple service orchestration, a.k.a coordination, of services
that defines a rescue personnel information service based on weather forecasts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It bundles various features of workflows to provide fully featured coordination
between independent services:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>wokflow instances are automatically created based on time intervals - every hour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>various services are invoked during execution to fetch data (from weather services)
or delegate to other services (alert service, information service, notification service)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at times services may not be accessible or returns unexpected responses,
so workflow is equipped with error handling and retry mechanism to improve fault tolerance</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Service orchestration is not just about calling services or consuming/producing
events, it is also about control logic. What to do based on various conditions
is one of the most powerful assets of workflows in this use case. One example of
such control logic is how to handle cases that require undoing already performed
operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Workflows come with a built in feature called compensation. Compensation
allows to define additional logic that should be invoked when a decision about compensating
some already done work is made. This is all defined within the workflow model and by that made explicit
to all involved parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

the <a href="examples.html#_weather_conditions">Weather conditions</a> example</p>

<h2 id="_database_record_processing"><a class="anchor" href="#_database_record_processing"></a>Database record processing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we know most of the data systems deal with is stored in databases.
Regardless of their type, this data is always a subject of modification.
Systems have to create, read, update and delete data stored in databases.
In most cases this logic is custom but has a well defined life cycle.
This life cycle is defined by business context it resides in. All this is is actually
a defined process that governs how and by whom data can be modified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For that reason, workflows make a good fit for this use case as well. It is not to replace
custom code, but is to enhance and/or simplify it.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-database.png" alt="Vacation request process">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above example, which handles vacation requests submitted by employees, illustrates
how database records can be used inside workflows that can manage their lifecycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use case itself is more about how data is being managed from a storage point of view
however still being part of a workflow. Each data type (in our example person and vacation
request records) is stored securely in a database, however most of modifications to this data
is controlled by our workflow. In this example the benefits of workflows in terms of isolation and
security are clearly visible, namely each workflow instance is responsible for a given set of
database records.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even tho data modifications are controlled by our workflow, each data record is being kept
in the database and accesible by tooling to build reports, dashboards, backups, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_batch_processing"><a class="anchor" href="#_batch_processing"></a>Batch processing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch processing is usually expressed as set of steps that need to happen
to process a given item. This makes a perfect fit for expressing it as
a workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch processing can have different trigger mechanisms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>time based e.g. every Friday night, or every day etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trigger based e.g. file has been put into a folder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manual e.g. user action triggers batch processing in background</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of how batch processing may be triggered, it will go over a defined
set of "steps". Some of these steps can receive huge sets of data as input,
others can split it into chunks or event individual items before triggering
processing logic. Workflows can be an excellent approach to model these steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/use-case-batch.png" alt="Batch processing process">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above example shows how files dropped into a directory can be processed
by different workflows depending on the file type (based on its extension).
There is a different workflow that deals with text files and another that
deals with pdf files.</p>

<h2 id="_kubernetes_operator"><a class="anchor" href="#_kubernetes_operator"></a>Kubernetes Operator</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/"><code>Kubernetes operators</code></a> are becoming more and more popular.
In most of the cases their logic is a sequence of steps that must be performed to provision particular service.
Operators are sort of watchers around <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/"><code>custom resources</code></a> and react
to following change events</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>custom resource created</p>

<li>
<p>custom resource updated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>custom resource deleted</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Essentially possibility to express operator logic as a workflow provides direct insights into what a given operator
does and what resources it has managed. Combined with capabilities of workflows e.g. isolation, error handling, retries,
compensation, times and many more it makes a great fit for building Kubernetes operators.</p>
